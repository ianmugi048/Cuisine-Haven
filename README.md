WEBSITE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a Website of a small restaurant to advertise and process online transactions. The purpose of the website was to enable customers to make online reservations, place orders online and to see what was offered and at what price. 
Website Description
The websites contains 4 sections, each designed to serve a specific service:
Home- Contains the general featured delicacies and welcome message to the website. 
About Us- Contains information about the restaurant, its location, services offered, the management team, vision, mission and values to assure the customer trust. 
Reservations- Contains a form to be filled about the details of reservation or orders the buyer wants. There is also a catalogue of meals offered and their prices to enable customers to know beforehand the pricing model.
Contact Us- Contains contact information of both the restaurant help team, as well as the technical team to address issues encountered navigating our website or to report any anomaly.
Each of the Sections contains a moving message at the bottom, which is an enticing welcome message.
Implementation of CRAP Principles of Design
The CRAP principles were implemented to enhance visual treatment to the website and create a uniform look across the website. 
1. Contrast- Contrasting colours were used in the text(white text on a dark background to ensure readability and aesthetics. 
Buttons designed with vibrant colours to draw user attention to action.
          2. Repetition- Fonts, colours, button style, and form in block display were incorporated to give the website a cohesive look and feel across all sections. 
The repeated footer ensures a consistent website alongside the uniformly structured navigation bar. 
          3. Alignment- Text and images were aligned to guide the user naturally through the content. 
4. Proximity- Related content was grouped together. We included the contact form with the contact information and the reservation section with a catalogue and reservation form. 
Unrelated sections were also adequately spaced to prevent clutter. 

Gains From The Project
1. Skill Development- We gained a higher proficiency in implementing website design as well as web page structuring and typing with HTML and CSS. 
2. Collaboration- The project entailed working together with a partner to come up with the final consumable project. This further prepares us for the corporate world that more often relies on collaboration and teamwork. 
3. Time management- This required working with fixed deadlines and strict timelines being that the project was done during a  time we were preparing for examinations in other units but still managed to pull it off.

Difficulties Encountered
1. Design hurdles- It was difficult choosing an appropriate background photograph as some were too bright or too dark making it hard to read the text for the user. Others were also very low resolution that made the website look unappealing while others were too large and that impacted loading times even on the Visual Studio Code LiveServer. 
Achieving an optimal balance between appearance and functionality took multiple iterations to come up with one final consumable. 

Conclusion
The project successfully met its objectives, delivering a functional and visually appealing website. The application of CRAP principles ensured a professional design, while the experience gained and challenges overcome contributed to significant learning and growth.


Future Recommendations
We would in future conduct user testing to gather feedback for continual development and improvement.
